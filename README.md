## Python Introduction Exercises
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises I've completed for a Python course. Each exercise includes a brief description and my solution in Python. 
The course covers fundamental concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.

### Getting Started
To get started with these exercises, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Exercises
The exercises are organized by topic in separate files. Each exercise has a description and my solution.

Here is a list of the topics covered in the exercises:
1. [Strings, f-strings, Lists, Math Operations](./Exercises/01.md)
2. [Functions, Loops, Conditionals](./Exercises/03.md)
3. [Data types (tuples, dictionaries, containers, sets) , Comprehension, Zip function](./Exercises/04.md)

### Cheatsheets
I've also created a [directory](./Cheatsheets) with cheatsheets that cover the theory I've learned. 

### Conclusion
Whether you are a beginner just starting out with Python or an experienced programmer looking to improve your skills, these exercises can be a valuable resource to help you practice and deepen your understanding of the language.

I hope that you find these exercises useful and that they provide you with a challenging and rewarding learning experience. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
