## Python Introduction Exercises
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises I've completed for a Python course. Each exercise includes a brief description and my solution in Python. 
The course covers fundamental concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.

### Getting Started
To get started with these exercises, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Exercises
The exercises are organized by topic in separate files. Each exercise has a description and my solution.

Here is a list of the topics covered in the exercises:
1. [Strings, f-strings, Lists, Math Operations](./Exercises/01.md)
2. [Functions, Loops, Conditionals](./Exercises/03.md)
3. [Data types (tuples, dictionaries, containers, sets) , Comprehension, Zip function](./Exercises/04.md)

### Cheatsheets
I also made a [directory](./Cheatsheets) with cheatsheets that cover the theory I've learned. 

### Conclusion
These exercises were a great way for me to solidify my understanding of Python programming concepts. I hope you find them helpful in your own learning journey!
